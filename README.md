# FLASHCARDS GUI APP
This is a flashcards application I created with python's tkinter library for the graphic user interface (GUI) and pandas library for editing csv files.
The program reads either French and Igbo words from a csv file containing the words. 
All the words are updated to a csv of words the user is yet to learn, then the program shows the words on a tkinter GUI window and the user will choose if they know the words or not and the words get removed from the words_to_learn file if the user knows them.
